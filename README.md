DocHub is a website, written in django. It's main goal is to provide a space for students (for now form the [ULB](https://ulb.ac.be) university) to collaborate, help each other and distribute old exams and exercices.

There is a [live instance of DocHub](https://dochub.be) hosted by [UrLab](https://urlab.be) and the [Cercle Informatique](https://cerkinfo.be).

```console
# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install unoconv python3-dev ruby libtiff5-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libfreetype6-dev liblcms2-dev libwebp-dev tcl8.6-dev tk8.6-dev python-tk mupdf-tools

./manage.py createuser
```

To add a requirement, write it in `requirements.in` file, and generate the requirements.txt file with the following command

```console

```

## Testing
