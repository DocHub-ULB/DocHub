DocHub is a website, written in django. It's main goal is to provide a space for students (for now form the [ULB](https://ulb.ac.be) university) to collaborate, help each other and distribute old exams and exercices.

There is a [live instance of DocHub](https://dochub.be) hosted by [UrLab](https://urlab.be) and the [Cercle Informatique](https://cerkinfo.be).

sudo systemctl enable --now redis
# Arch linux
sudo pacman -S unoconv ruby python mupdf-tools redis
sudo systemctl enable --now redis
```


### Installation

If you install the packages listed above and follow the installation steps exactly, you should have a running version
of DocHub on your machine. If it's not the case, **you are not the problem**, it means we have a bug.

Please open an issue with the output of your console and describe the problem you encountered, we **will** and will fix
it for you and the all the next users :rocket:

To create the virtual environment and install the requirements, run the following command:
```console
make install

# Alternatively, if you prefer to do it by hand
python3 -m venv ve
source ve/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To create a database and fill it with some dummy data, run the following command. Observe the output, it
will tell you the credentials you can then use to log in.
```console
make database
```

### Run

This will have to be done each time you want to run DocHub.

```console
source ve/bin/activate
./manage.py runserver
```

Then go http://localhost:8000/

There will already be 2 users in the database, both with `test` as a password:

- $(USER) : your username on your machine
- blabevue

### Misc

#### Add another user to the db

```console
./manage.py createuser
```

#### Requirements

To add a requirement, write it in `requirements.in` file, and generate the requirements.txt file with the following command

```console
pip-compile
```

## Testing

Run only fast tests (total time < 2 sec) : not testing actual file conversions

```console
py.test -k "not slow"
```

Run all tests (~20 sec)

```console
py.test
```
