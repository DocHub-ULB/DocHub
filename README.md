DocHub is a website written in django. Its main goal is to provide a space for students
(for now form the [ULB](https://ulb.ac.be) university) to collaborate, help each other and distribute old exams and exercises.

There is a [live instance of DocHub](https://dochub.be) hosted by [UrLab](https://urlab.be) and the [Cercle Informatique](https://cerkinfo.be).

## Tech

DocHub currently (Feb 2025) runs with Python 3.13 and Postgresql 16.

### Installation

If you install the packages listed above and follow the installation steps exactly, you should have a running version
of DocHub on your machine. If it's not the case, **you are not the problem**, it means we have a bug.

Please open an issue with the output of your console and describe the problem you encountered, we **will** and will fix
it for you and all the next users :rocket:

First, install uv and system dependencies:

```console
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install unoconv python3-dev ruby libtiff5-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libfreetype6-dev liblcms2-dev libwebp-dev tcl8.6-dev tk8.6-dev python-tk mupdf-tools redis-server
sudo systemctl enable --now redis-server
# Fedora
sudo dnf install unoconv python-devel ruby mupdf redis
sudo systemctl enable --now redis
# Arch linux
sudo pacman -S unoconv ruby python mupdf-tools redis
sudo systemctl enable --now redis
```

To create a database and fill it with some fake data, run the following command.
Observe the output, it will tell you the credentials you can then use to log in.
```console
make database
```

### Run

This will have to be done each time you want to run DocHub.

```console
uv run manage.py runserver
```

Then go http://localhost:8000/

There will already be 2 users in the database, both with `test` as a password:

- $(USER): your username on your machine
- blabevue

### Misc

#### Add another user to the db

```console
uv run manage.py createuser
```

#### Requirements

To add a requirement, use:

```console
uv add <package-name>
```

## Testing

Run only fast tests (total time < 2 sec) : not testing actual file conversions

```console
uv run pytest -k "not slow"
```

Run all tests (~20 sec)

```console
uv run pytest
```
