# Beta402 - DocHub


Beta402 or DocHub is a website, written in django. It's main goal is to provide a space for students (for now form the [ULB](http://ulb.ac.be) univeristy) to collaborate, help each other and distribute old exams and exercices.

There is a [live instance of DocHub](http://cours.urlab.be) hosted by UrLab.
