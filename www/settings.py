# 	- default.py if you want it to be for all instances of b402
# 	- dev.py if you want it to be for all dev instances
# 	- prod.py if you want it to be for all production instances

# If you want to configure something instance related, please write it

# You can use production.py or dev.py as a template for local.py or just use

# in local.py and then overwrite some values
#
# If local.py does not exist, configuration will be loaded from dev.py directly
